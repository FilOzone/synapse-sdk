A JavaScript/TypeScript SDK for interacting with Filecoin Synapse - a smart-contract based marketplace for storage and other services in the Filecoin ecosystem.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **BREAKING CHANGES in v0.24.0**: Major terminology updates have been introduced. **Pandora** is now **Warm Storage**, **Proof Sets** are now **Data Sets**, **Roots** are now **Pieces** and **Storage Providers** are now **Service Providers**. Additionally, the storage API has been improved with a new context-based architecture. See the [Migration Guide](/guides/migration-guide/#0240) section for migration instructions.


The Synapse SDK provides an interface to Filecoin's decentralized services ecosystem:

- **üöÄ Recommended Usage**: Use the high-level `Synapse` class for a streamlined experience with sensible defaults
- **üîß Composable Components**: Import and use individual components for fine-grained control over specific functionality

The SDK handles all the complexity of blockchain interactions, provider selection, and data management, so you can focus on building your application.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @filoz/synapse-sdk ethers
```

Note: `ethers` v6 is a peer dependency and must be installed separately.

## Project Structure

This project uses a monorepo structure managed by `pnpm` workspaces. Core libraries reside in the `packages/` directory, examples in `examples/`, and this documentation site in `docs/`.

## Key Concepts

Before diving into the code, understand these fundamental concepts:

- **Service Contracts**: Smart contracts that manage specific services (like storage). Currently, **Warm Storage** is the primary service contract that handles storage operations and payment validation.
- **Payment Rails**: Automated payment streams between clients and service providers, managed by the Payments contract. When you create a data set in Warm Storage, it automatically creates corresponding payment rails.
- **Data Sets**: Collections of stored data managed by Warm Storage. Each data set has an associated payment rail that handles the ongoing storage payments.
- **Pieces**: Individual units of data identified by PieceCID (content-addressed identifiers). Multiple pieces can be added to a data set for storage.
- **PDP (Proof of Data Possession)**: The cryptographic protocol that verifies storage providers are actually storing the data they claim to store. Providers must periodically prove they possess the data.
- **Validators**: Service contracts (like Warm Storage) act as validators for payment settlements, ensuring services are delivered before payments are released.

## Usage

The [`Synapse`](/api/synapse/classes/synapse/) class provides a complete, easy-to-use interface for interacting with Filecoin storage services.
