The **Synapse SDK** is your gateway to **Filecoin Onchain Cloud** — a decentralized, programmable cloud platform built on Filecoin. This comprehensive guide will walk you through everything you need to know to start building with the SDK.

The Synapse SDK provides an interface to Filecoin's decentralized services ecosystem:

- **🚀 Recommended Usage**: Use the high-level `Synapse` class for a streamlined experience with sensible defaults
- **🔧 Composable Components**: Import and use individual components for fine-grained control over specific functionality

The SDK handles all the complexity of blockchain interactions, provider selection, and data management, so you can focus on building your application.

### Key Concepts

Before diving into the code, understand these fundamental concepts:

- **Service Contracts**: Smart contracts that manage specific services (like storage). Currently, **Warm Storage** is the primary service contract that handles storage operations and payment validation.
- **Payment Rails**: Automated payment streams between clients and service providers, managed by the Payments contract. When you create a data set in Warm Storage, it automatically creates corresponding payment rails.
- **Data Sets**: Collections of stored data managed by Warm Storage. Each data set has an associated payment rail that handles the ongoing storage payments.
- **Pieces**: Individual units of data identified by PieceCID (content-addressed identifiers). Multiple pieces can be added to a data set for storage.
- **PDP (Proof of Data Possession)**: The cryptographic protocol that verifies storage providers are actually storing the data they claim to store. Providers must periodically prove they possess the data.
- **Validators**: Service contracts (like Warm Storage) act as validators for payment settlements, ensuring services are delivered before payments are released.

### What You'll Learn

By the end of this guide, you'll understand how to:
- Install and configure the Synapse SDK
- Connect to Filecoin networks (mainnet and calibration)
- Upload and download data using decentralized storage
- Manage payments and allowances
- Work with different authentication methods
- Use advanced features like CDN and custom providers

## Installation

The Synapse SDK requires Node.js 18+ and can be installed via npm, yarn, or pnpm:

```bash
pnpm install @filoz/synapse-sdk ethers
```

Note: `ethers` v6 is a peer dependency and must be installed separately.

## Quick Start Example

The [`Synapse`](/api/synapse/classes/synapse/) class provides a complete, easy-to-use interface for interacting with Filecoin storage services.

Get started with storage in just a few lines of code:

### 1: Initialize the SDK

First, set up the Synapse SDK with your credentials:

```typescript
import { Synapse, RPC_URLS } from '@filoz/synapse-sdk'

// Initialize SDK with your private key and RPC endpoint
const synapse = await Synapse.create({
  privateKey: '0x...', // Your private key
  rpcURL: RPC_URLS.calibration.websocket  // Use calibration testnet for testing
})

console.log('SDK initialized successfully!')
console.log(`Connected to network: ${synapse.getNetwork()}`)
```

### 2: Get Test Tokens

Before you can deposit USDFC, you'll need test tokens from faucets. For the calibration testnet:

**Get tFIL tokens:**
- Visit the [Filecoin Calibration Faucet](https://faucet.calibnet.chainsafe-fil.io/funds.html)
- Enter your wallet address to receive free tFIL tokens
- You need FIL for gas fees

**Get test USDFC tokens:**
- Visit the [Filecoin Calibration USDFC Faucet](https://forest-explorer.chainsafe.dev/faucet/calibnet_usdfc)
- Enter your wallet address to receive free test USDFC tokens
- You need USDFC for storage payments

### 3: USDFC Deposit

Before storing data, you need to deposit USDFC tokens in your payments account:

```typescript
import { TOKENS } from '@filoz/synapse-sdk'
import { ethers } from 'ethers'

// Check current USDFC balance
const walletBalance = await synapse.payments.walletBalance(TOKENS.USDFC)
console.log(`Wallet USDFC balance: ${ethers.formatUnits(walletBalance, 18)} USDFC`)

// Deposit USDFC tokens if needed (minimum 10 USDFC for testing)
const minDeposit = ethers.parseUnits('10', 18)
if (walletBalance < minDeposit) {
  console.log('Depositing USDFC tokens...')
  const depositTx = await synapse.payments.deposit(TOKENS.USDFC, minDeposit, {
    onAllowanceCheck: (current, required) => {
      console.log(`Allowance check: ${ethers.formatUnits(current, 18)} / ${ethers.formatUnits(required, 18)} USDFC`)
    },
    onApprovalTransaction: (tx) => {
      console.log(`Approval transaction: ${tx.hash}`)
    },
    onDepositStarting: () => {
      console.log('Starting deposit transaction...')
    }
  })
  await depositTx.wait()
  console.log('Deposit complete!')
}
```

### 4: Payment Setup

Approve the storage service to create payment rails on your behalf:

```typescript
// Approve storage service for automated payments
const warmStorageAddress = synapse.getWarmStorageAddress()
console.log(`Approving Warm Storage service: ${warmStorageAddress}`)

const approveTx = await synapse.payments.approveService(
  warmStorageAddress,
  ethers.parseUnits('10', 18),   // Rate allowance: 10 USDFC per epoch
  ethers.parseUnits('1000', 18), // Lockup allowance: 1000 USDFC total
  86400n                         // Max lockup period: 30 days (in epochs)
)
await approveTx.wait()
console.log('Service approval complete!')
```

### 5: Store and Download Data

Now you can upload data to decentralized storage and retrieve it:

```typescript
// Upload data - SDK automatically selects provider and creates data set if needed
// (your first upload will take longer than subsequent uploads due to setup)
const uploadResult = await synapse.storage.upload(
  new TextEncoder().encode('🚀 Welcome to decentralized storage on Filecoin! Your data is safe here. 🌍')
)

console.log(`Upload complete!`)
console.log(`PieceCID: ${uploadResult.pieceCid}`)
console.log(`Size: ${uploadResult.size} bytes`)

// Download data from any provider that has it
const data = await synapse.storage.download(uploadResult.pieceCid)
const text = new TextDecoder().decode(data)

console.log('Downloaded data:', text)
console.log('✅ Data storage and retrieval successful!')
```

## What's Next?

For more control over provider selection and data set management:

```typescript
// Create a storage context with specific provider
const context = await synapse.storage.createContext({
  providerId: 1, // Use specific provider
  withCDN: true, // Enable CDN for faster retrieval
  metadata: {
    category: 'documents',
    version: '1.0'
  }
})

// Upload to this specific context
const result = await context.upload(data)

// Download from this context
const downloaded = await context.download(result.pieceCid)
```

#### Finding Service Providers

```typescript
// Get all approved providers
const storageInfo = await synapse.storage.getStorageInfo()
const providers = storageInfo.providers

console.log('Available providers:')
providers.forEach(provider => {
  console.log(`ID: ${provider.id}, Address: ${provider.address}`)
  console.log(`  Storage URL: ${provider.storageUrl}`)
  console.log(`  CDN URL: ${provider.cdnUrl}`)
})
```
